    <h2 id="creation">The Creation of the Minotaur</h2>
    <p>
      Our story starts with Minos, king of Crete and son of Zeus (which is always a good sign), who prayed to Poseidon to send him a snow-white bull as a sign of his right to rule Crete over his brothers, Rhadamanthys or Sarpedon. Poseidon agrees, on the condition that Minos sacrifice the bull to him once he’s done with it. Everyone is impressed by the bull and Minos becomes king. However, Minos likes the bull so much that he decides it is far too awesome to sacrifice, keeps it, and sacrifices a different, significantly less impressive bull instead. This of course enrages Poseidon and so, in retribution, he has Aphrodite step in to make Minos’ wife Pasiphaë fall in love with the bull. The Cretan bull has standards however and is not too enthused at being propositioned by some disgusting biped and so Pasiphaë must get creative. Luckily for her (kind of?) known architect and craftsman Daedalus is on Crete at the time. So, Pasiphaë commissions him to build her a hollow wooden cow suit. Daedalus is a professional and thus, takes the job without asking any superfluous questions. Pasiphaë’s
      creative solution to her unrequited desire problem succeeds and nine months later, Crete is graced with the minotaur. Unfortunately, the minotaur, as your standard abomination, is born with a diet of only humans and absolutely no other options. Instead of killing the beast or just letting it starve to death, Minos consults the oracle at Delphi who tells him to just lock the thing up somewhere it can have its space. Fortunately, Daedalus is still around, and Minos commissions him to design and build a massive labyrinth for the minotaur. With the minotaur locked up in the labyrinth and out of risk of rampaging, Minos only needs to procure food for it. The exact reasons for his decision vary depending on the telling, but in the end, Minos demands 14 young Athenians be sent to Crete every few years as a sacrifice, and the children are sent into the labyrinth to feed the minotaur.

    <h2 id="theseus">Theseus</h2>
    <p>
      Around the third round of Athenian sacrifices to Crete, the routine catches the attention of Athens’ favourite founder hero (questionable choice Athens), Theseus. So, Theseus sails his way over to Crete with a big sword and absolutely no game plan, where he meets Minos’ daughter Ariadne, who immediately falls completely in love with him. Wanting to help the cute boy, Ariadne gives Theseus a clew, a ball of thread, to help him retrace his path so he can escape the labyrinth. With his exit strategy sorted, Theseus ventures into the labyrinth to find the minotaur and battle until he finally manages to decapitate it. However, Minos is inexplicably none too pleased that his monster is dead and Theseus and Ariadne, along with the young Athenians rescued from the labyrinth, have to make a quick escape from Crete. After escaping, Theseus makes the very considerate decision to abandon Ariadne on the shore of Naxos while she’s sleeping. Because Theseus is just a really great guy.

    <h2 id="icarus">Icarus</h2>
    <p>
      Icarus may be one of the best-known names from Greek mythology nowadays, we’ve all heard the saying about how he flew too close to the sun. However, for many, that’s about all the information they’ve got. Icarus was the son of Daedalus, the creator of the labyrinth. Once Daedalus had finished the project, Minos decided that it would really be very unwise to rely on the labyrinth as a handy murder weapon if there were people out there who knew the way out. So, since it worked so well with his first problem, he decided to keep on with locking away those who’s existence was proving to be a problem for him. And so, Daedalus and his son Icarus were locked away in a tower, unable to leave by land or sea, due to Minos having an eye on all transport. However, Daedalus is, of course, an inventor and so he goes ahead and constructs two sets of wings, for himself and Icarus, out of feathers and wax. Daedalus warns Icarus that he needs to be careful when flying: if he flies too low, the spray from the sea will weigh down his wings and he won’t be able to fly anymore, if he flies too high, the sun’s heat will melt the wax and he’ll fall. Unfortunately, Icarus is young and stupid and so he immediately disregards the warning and flies up as high as he can. The sun melts the wax, the wings fall apart, and Icarus falls into the sea and drowns.
